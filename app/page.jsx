He looks like an 18-year-old, wearing a clean all-white outfit including sweatshirt, jogger pants, and sneakers. He has short dark hair, light stubble, and is sitting casually with one arm resting on his knee in a relaxed pose. Next to him stands a highly detailed, realistic 3D version of Sonic the Hedgehog, with vibrant blue fur, green eyes, white gloves, and red shoes. The background is stylish and suitable for a professional outdoor photoshoot, with soft even lighting. The overall mood is modern, friendly, and stylish, blending reality with CGI while keeping the original face unchanged.`,

The selfie should feel natural but with a touch of elegance, keeping the focus on the person and the iPhone while the background remaining non-distracting.`,
